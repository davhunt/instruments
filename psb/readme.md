## PSB (Prosocial Behavior Survey)

### Versions
The PSB questionnaires are currently on the original release. The NDCLab versions were extracted from the [ABCD youth questionnaire](https://nda.nih.gov/data_structure.html?short_name=abcd_psb01) and the [ABCD parent questionnaire](https://nda.nih.gov/data_structure.html?short_name=psb01), both extracted from the NIMH Data Archive in January 2023. Instructions for all versions were extracted from PDFs shared directly by researchers involved in the ABCD study and were modified for online data collection (“mark the box” > “select the option”).
