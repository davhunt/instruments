This instrument references a stressfulness rating of particular events, in addition to the 25 item questionnaire.  The NDCLab was unable to find more detail and has therefore not included any additional items in our use of the instrument.

The original instrument was constructed specifically for adults of Mexican origin.  In this revision, "my family's heritage language" was substituted for "Spanish."  The NDCLab uses this version.  As no information was found regarding the preamble to introduce the questions to participants, we use a generic "Please rate how strongly you agree/disagree with the following statements."
