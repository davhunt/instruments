##### masi(_a)
This is the original version used by the NDCLab. It only included the English self report and was limited to participants who selected a non-White ethnic/racial identification in the demographics survey. This version is now deprecated.


### Scoring Script
The MASI questionnaire is included in the repository scoring script. Threshold for scoring is 100%. See data dictionary for further details.


### Translations
The translation of the self report into Spanish for US/Latin America was performed by members of the NDCLab in 2023.  Included is a .csv file providing transparency on the translation process. Please report any issues with the MASI translation by posting an issue in this GitHub repository.

This instrument references a stressfulness rating of particular events, in addition to the 25 item questionnaire.  The NDCLab was unable to find more detail and has therefore not included any additional items in our use of the instrument.

The original instrument was constructed specifically for adults of Mexican origin.  In this revision, "my family's heritage language" was substituted for "Spanish."  The NDCLab uses this version.  As no information was found regarding the preamble to introduce the questions to participants, we use a generic "Please rate how strongly you agree/disagree with the following statements."
