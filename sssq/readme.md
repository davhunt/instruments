## SSSQ (Short Stress State Questionnaire)

The SSSQ pre-task and post-task questionnaires are used together.

### Versions
#### sssqpre
##### sssqpre_b
No variables were modified in this version, but the matrix header described below was corrected the match the official version of the instrument. Only the English self report is available.

##### sssqpre(_a)
This is the original version used by the NDCLab. It contains an error in the second matrix, which reads "at the moment," but should read "during the past ten minutes." Only the English self report was available. This version is now deprecated.

#### sssqpost
The SSSQ post-task questionnaire is currently on the original release. Only the English self report is available.


### Scoring Script
The SSSQ questionnaire (including pre- and post-) is included in the repository scoring script. Threshold for scoring is 80%. See data dictionary for further details. Note, however, that the NDCLab scoring script does **not** compute any delta scores for SSSQ questionnaires; individual researchers may want to manually compute these for each subscore by subtracting the pre-task score from the post-task score.
