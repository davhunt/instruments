## SPAI (Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory)

### Versions
The SPAI questionnaires are currently on the original release.  "Circle the number" has been replaced with "select the option" for online use. In order to optimize the respondent experience in REDCap, standalone questions (1-8, 22, and 23) are presented with radio buttons rather than as a matrix. The REDCap upload has been designed to present the 11-item short form by default; to use the full version, the "@HIDDEN" action tag needs to be removed from all questions.
