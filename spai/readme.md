## SPAI (Social Phobia and Anxiety Inventory)

### Versions
The SPAI questionnaires are currently on the original release.  "Circle the number" has been replaced with "select the option" for online use. In order to optimize the respondent experience in REDCap, standalone questions (1-8, 22, and 23) are presented with radio buttons rather than as a matrix. Each version (child, parent) is available in both the short version and the long version: question numbering is the same in both, with the short version being merely a subset of the full instrument (other questions have been deleted for display purposes).

### Scoring Script

### Translations
The Spanish US/LatAm version of the parental report was translated by members of the [FIU CAPP program](https://capp.fiu.edu/). In may 2023, the Spanish header for questions i21-i23 was corrected.
