## postTask (Post-Task Questionnaires)

This repo contains modifiable (.docx) and PDF versions of generic post-task questionnaires used by the NDCLab, along with the associated REDCap import .zip and survey PDF.  When using post-task questionnaires in studies that involve multiple conditions (for example, social and nonsocial), it will be necessary to update the questionnaire instructions appropriately.  For example, if a participant completes a flanker task in both a social and nonsocial condition, the two questionnaires could be customized as:
###### Social Condition
> You completed the arrow task twice. Please complete the survey below about the FIRST time that you completed the task.
###### Nonsocial Condition
> You completed the arrow task twice. Please complete the survey below about the SECOND time that you completed the task.

###### postTaskA
Questions about the participant's experience, especially geared toward computer tasks with a focus on accuracy and speed.

###### postTaskB
Questions about the participant's experience, specific to the putt-putt-dataset golf-putting task.

###### postTaskC
Questions about the participant's experience, generic to any task.  This is a very short version.

###### postTaskD
Questions about the participant's experience, generic to any task.  This is a longer version.

###### postTaskE
Ten questions about the participant's experience, generic to any "game" task.

###### postTaskF
Ten questions about the participant's experience with a "speech" task.
