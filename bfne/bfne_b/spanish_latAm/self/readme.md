## BFNE, Self Report, Spanish (US/LatAm)

These translations into Spanish for US/Latin America were updated by members of the NDCLab in 2023 on the basis of [this European Spanish translation](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228680069_Propiedades_psicometricas_de_la_Escala_de_Miedo_a_la_Evaluacion_Negativa_version_breve_BFNE_en_muestra_clinica#:~:text=El%20BFNE%20est%C3%A1%20formado%20por,IV%2DTR%20(2000).). As part of this localization process, items that were worded for reverse scoring in the European Spanish version were adapted to unreversed scoring, in order to match the scoring for the English version of the BFNE used by NDCLab.
