## DERS (Difficulty in Emotion Regulation)

### Versions
The DERS questionnaire is currently on the original release. The NDCLab version was extracted from the NIMH Data Archive, ["Difficulty in Emotion Regulation" questionnaire](https://nda.nih.gov/data_structure.html?short_name=diff_emotion_reg_p01) in February 2023. Several typos were corrected in the English, and "hija/o" was transitioned to "niño/a" in the Spanish.
