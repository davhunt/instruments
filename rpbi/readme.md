## RPBI (Report of Parent Behavior Inventory)

### Versions
The RPBI questionnaires are currently on the original release.  "Circle" has been replaced with "select" for online use. Additionally, for the child report, "mother" was replaced with "caregiver."  Note that the "C" (for "child") and "P" (for "parent") modifiers are typically placed before the name of the measure (i.e., CRPBI and PRPBI); here, we have followed NDCLab convention and placed the modifers after the name of the measure.

### Scoring Script
RPBI subscores for "Acceptance" and 'Psychological Control" are included for the child self report and parental reports in the repository scoring script. Threshold for scoring is 100%. The third factor, "Firm Control," is not included in the repository scoring script. NDCLab uses [0,2] as the response range, although it should be noted that some other researchers have used [1,3].


### Translations
The Spanish US/LatAm version of the parental report was translated by members of the [FIU CAPP program](https://capp.fiu.edu/) and updated by members of the NDCLab in 2023. Included is a .csv file providing transparency on the revision process. Please report any issues with the RPBI translation by posting an issue in this GitHub repository.
