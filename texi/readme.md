## TEXI (Teenage Executive Functioning Inventory)


### Versions
##### texi_b
At the request of the original author, the word "sometimes" was removed from several items.  The NDCLab updated our own copy of the instrument as we were responsible for updating the Spanish translation. Details of which items were changed is available in the .csv file detailing the Spanish translations (in this subfolder); changes were performed by the original translation team.  When uploaded to REDCap, the instructions were modified for online data collection by deleting the last sentence (referring to "circling" a response).
| Audience | Language |
| :--  | :--  |
| self report | English; Spanish US/LatAM; Spanish Spain  |
| other report | English; Spanish US/LatAM; Spanish Spain |

##### texi(_a)
This is the original version of the ADEXI used by the NDCLab, draw directly from the then-current version available from [the author](https://chexi.se/).  Prior to translation by members of the NDCLab, several clarifying modifications were made; these are recorded in the 'modifications' subfolder for English and were notified to the team at the Karolinska Institutet.  It includes the English, Spanish US/LatAM, and European Spanish self reports. This version of the TEXI is now deprecated.


### Scoring Script
The English self-report of the modified TEXI is included in the repository scoring script. Threshold for scoring is 80%. See data dictionary for further details.


### Translations
The translations of the self-report and other-report  into Spanish for US/Latin America and European Spanish were performed by members of the NDCLab in 2021.  Included is a .csv file providing transparency on the translation process. Please report any issues with the TEXI translations by posting an issue in this GitHub repository.
