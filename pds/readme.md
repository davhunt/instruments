### Scoring Script
The PDS questionnaires are included in the repository scoring script. Threshold for scoring is 80%. Note that scores are not calculated for respondents who do not indicate either male or female sex (as only the three generic questions are shown to these respondents). See data dictionary for further details.


### Translations
The Spanish translations of the parent reports are based on translations available in the [NIMH Data Archive](https://nda.nih.gov/data_structure.html?short_name=abcd_ppdms01), consulted in January 2023. These were supplemented by additional translations performed by members of the NDCLab in 2023.  Included is a .csv file providing transparency on the translation process. Please report any issues with the PDS translation by posting an issue in this GitHub repository.
