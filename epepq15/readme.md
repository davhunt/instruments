Based on this validation, the NDCLab uses an 11-point Likert scale (rather than a 0-100 visual analog scale) and scores the total score and subscores (cognitive interference, negative self, and thoughts about the past) by means of averaging.  Additionally, questions 9 and 10 are dropped from the questionnaire as described in the appendix of the Fems et al. (2008) paper, and the remaining items renumbered accordingly.
