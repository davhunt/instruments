## VIA (Vancouver Index of Acculturation)

### Versions
The VIA questionnaire is currently on the original release. Only the English self report is available. The NDCLab version was extracted from the NIMH Data Archive, ["Youth Vancouver Index of Acculturation" questionnaire](https://nda.nih.gov/data_structure.html?short_name=vancouver_identity_accult01) in January 2023, to which an initial yes/no question ("Do you have a heritage culture?") was added for survey flow.


### Scoring Script
The VIA questionnaire is included in the repository scoring script. Threshold for scoring is 80%. See data dictionaries for further details. (Note: subscores in the data dictionary are based on averaging as a working scoring model.)
