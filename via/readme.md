## VIA (Vancouver Index of Acculturation)

### Versions
The VIA questionnaire is currently on the original release. The NDCLab version was extracted from the NIMH Data Archive, ["Vancouver Index of Acculturation" questionnaire](https://nda.nih.gov/data_structure.html?short_name=abcd_via01) in January 2023, to which an initial yes/no question ("Do you have a heritage culture?") was added for survey flow.

### Translations
The Spanish US/LatAm version of the self report is drawn directly from the ABCD study.  The initial question added was translated by members of the NDCLab as part of the MASI.
