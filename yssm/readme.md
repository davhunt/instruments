Where available, the Spanish US/LatAm version of the parental report is drawn directly from the ABCD study. Content that was not available from NDA was translated by members of the NDCLab in 2023.  Included is a .csv file providing transparency on the translation process. Please report any issues with the YSSM translation by posting an issue in this GitHub repository.
