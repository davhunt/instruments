## Consent

Request the current consent from the NDCLab manager.  Once received:

1. Upload the .zip file to REDCap in the Designer.
2. Enable the survey settings and make the following adjustments:
    * modify Survey Title and Survey Instructions by referencing the PDF provided by the lab manager.
    * under "e-Consent Framework," select "Auto-Archiver + e-Consent Framework"
    * unclick "Allow e-Consent responses to be edited by users"
    * specify the e-Consent version (e.g. 2022-11)
3. If the consent indicates that participants will receive a copy, change "Send confirmation email?" to "Yes", adjust the form as appropriate, and click "Include PDF of completed survey as attachment." (Be certain that, under Project Setup, you have enabled "Designate an email field for communications" and have it set to the relevant participant-completed field)
4. Save your changes.
5. Following IRB amendments, the lab manager will provide you with an updated consent. Do not override. Instead, add this as a new instrument and adjust the REDCap settings such that new participants do not see the old consent.
