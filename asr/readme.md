## ASR (Adult Self-Report)

This repo contains the PDF (with marks to indicate excluded content) for the ASR questionnaire.  To date, the NDCLab has not used the ASR for data collection and therefore no REDCap zip or PDF is available.


### Scoring Script
The ASR is not included in the repository scoring script.
