## ASR (Adult Self-Report)

### Versions
This repo contains the PDF (with marks to indicate planned content to exclude) for the ASR questionnaire.  To date, the NDCLab has not used the ASR for data collection and therefore no REDCap zip or PDF is available.


### Scoring Script
The ASR is **not** included in the repository scoring script.
