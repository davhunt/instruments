## CDI2 (Child Depression Inventory 2)

This repo contains the CDI2 questionnaires.  The child version contains a question (item 8) relating to suicide; therefore, special care must be taken in the administration of this questionnaire to ensure that researchers are immediately aware when any participant has indicated suicidal ideation in responding to this questionnaire and that this triggers the appropriate protocols to ensure participant safety.


### Versions
The CDI2 questionnaires are currently on the original release. The instructions have been modified from the official versions to account for online distribution (e.g., "circle" replaced with "select").
