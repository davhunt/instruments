## COVID Questionnaires

### Versions
##### covid_c
The NDCLab pivoted from using an in-house questionnaire to this short version of the COVID Impacts Questionnaire from the University of Montana. Only the English self report is available.

##### covid_b
This revision is a truncation of the original questionnaire.  Most questions were reworded to ensure logical section headers.
**Reworded variables:** i1-i6
**Renumbered variables:** i15>i7, i16>i8, i17>i9, i21>i10
**Deleted variables:** i7-i14, i18-i20, i22-i24
Only the English self report was available, and was unscored. This version is now deprecated.

##### covid(_a)
This is the original questionnaire used by the NDCLab.  It covers a broad range of questions relating to experiences during, or otherwise associated with, the COVID-19 pandemic.  Only the English self report was available, and was unscored. It is now deprecated.


### Scoring Script
The COVID questionnaire (version c) is included in the repository scoring script. Threshold for scoring is 100%. See data dictionary for further details.
