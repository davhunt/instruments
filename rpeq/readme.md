No actual copy of the instrument was found, so the questions were drawn from the paper above and the instructions were inferred from both the Prinstein and De Los Reyes papers. As NDCLab will be using this instrument with adolescents younger than 13, "teen" was clarified to mean an age-group peer in the participant instructions.
