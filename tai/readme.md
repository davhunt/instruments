## TAI (Test Anxiety Inventory)

### Versions
##### tai_b
The REDCap survey was modified to ensure proper scoring thresholding was possible. This entailed making all questions required and changing the single "Check if it applies to you" radio button to two (Yes (reflects my experience)/No (does not apply)) radio button options. Survey instructions were also modified for online use, changing "place a checkmark on the line next to the number of the statement" to "choose 'Yes' next to the statement." Only the English self report is available.

##### tai(_a)
This is the original version used by the NDCLab and **cannot be scored using the scoring script**. The original instructions were modified to provide clarity within the REDCap platform with "If you incorrectly marked an item, click "Reset" for the corresponding item." Only the English self report was available. This version is now deprecated.


### Scoring Script
The TAI questionnaire is included in the repository scoring script. Threshold for scoring is 100%. In essence, given that all questions are yes/no, "sum" scoring is a count of all items that are true for a given participant. See data dictionary for further details.
