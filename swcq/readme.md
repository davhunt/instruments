## SWCQ (Self-Worth Contingency Questionnaire)

### Versions
The SWCQ questionnaire is currently on the original release. Only the English self report is available.  The questions were drawn directly from a version provided by the author in January 2023 (swcq.docx).  The instructions in the original paper form were modified for online data collection.


### Notes
The language of the matrix header for questions i33-i36 was modified so that questions under the header can be hidden and the header will still make sense.


### Scoring Script
The SWCQ questionnaire is included in the repository scoring script. Threshold for scoring is 100%. Scoring instructions were received directly form the author in January 2023 (swcq-scoring.doc). See data dictionaries for further details.
