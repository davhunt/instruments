## RSRI (Retrospective Self-Report of Inhibition)

### Versions
The RSRI questionnaire is currently on the original release. The self report was drawn from the 1992 Reznick et al. paper; in the instructions, we modified Grade 6 for Grade 5 as elementary schools in the Miami-Dade County Public School system most often end at Grade 5. Additionally, the response options for questions 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 19, 24, and 27 did not seem appropriate and were exchanged for another, more appropriate response option from the original paper.  The parent report is identical to the self-report except that all instances of the first person have been changed to refer to the respondent's child.
