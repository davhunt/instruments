## DSM XC (DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure Youth Self Report)

### Versions
The DSM XC questionnaire is currently on the original release and is made by and available directly from the APA. The DSM XC is only available in English. The Level 1 child (ages 11-17) self-report is available here; the APA also provides an adult self-report and a parent/guardian-report for children (ages 6-17). The NDCLab version was extracted from the NIMH Data Archive, [“DSM-5 Self-Rated Level 1 Cross-Cutting Symptom Measure Youth Self Report” questionnaire](https://nda.nih.gov/data_structure.html?short_name=cde_dsm5crossyouth01) in April 2023. The instructions were drawn from the APA and modified to match NIMH formatting (deleted "during the past TWO (2) WEEKS.") and for online data collection (“circle the number” > “select the option”).
